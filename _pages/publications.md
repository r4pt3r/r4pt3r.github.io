**Detection and Real- Time Monitoring of Sulfur Dioxide Concentration from Automobile Exhaust Using IoT - [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9489190)**

This research focuses on leveraging IoT technology to monitor sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from vehicles. By integrating sensors with a microcontroller and connecting them to the ThingSpeak cloud, real-time data on SO2 and CO concentrations is captured and displayed through an Android application. An alert system, developed using IFTTT, notifies users when SO2 emissions exceed safety limits, contributing to reduced air pollution from automobiles.

 **CoV2eX: A COVID-19 Website with Region-wise Sentiment Classification using the Top Trending Social Media Keywords - [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9419415)**

This study examines the psychological impact of COVID-19 by analyzing region-wise sentiment through tweets related to the pandemic. By using these tweets for model training, we generated insights into the average emotions conveyed across different regions. The findings, along with COVID-19 guidelines and data, were presented on a website, offering governments valuable information to address mental health challenges during the pandemic.
