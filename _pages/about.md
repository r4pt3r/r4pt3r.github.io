Hi, I’m **Adarsh**, a data engineer passionate about making sense of complex data and building clean, scalable solutions.

I’ve spent the last few years working across healthcare, logistics, and enterprise tech, helping teams streamline their data workflows. Whether it’s designing cloud-based ETL pipelines, transforming legacy systems, or optimizing big data environments, I enjoy solving real-world problems with tools like **Azure, Databricks, Spark, SQL, and Python**.

Currently based in **Dublin**, I’m pursuing a Master’s in **Data Analytics** at Dublin Business School while continuing to explore interesting data projects. My work focuses on data engineering, automation, and governance — making data more accessible, reliable, and insightful.

Before moving into the data space, I was part of **Team bi0s**, India’s top CTF cybersecurity team, and received a **Black Hat Asia scholarship** for my interest in data protection and cloud security.

If you're working with data or just enjoy swapping notes on tech, I’d love to connect.
