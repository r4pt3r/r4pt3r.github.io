Hi, Iâ€™m **Adarsh**, a data engineer passionate about making sense of complex data and building clean, scalable solutions.

Iâ€™ve spent the last few years working across healthcare, logistics, and enterprise tech, helping teams streamline their data workflows. Whether itâ€™s designing cloud-based ETL pipelines, transforming legacy systems, or optimizing big data environments, I enjoy solving real-world problems with tools like **Azure, Databricks, Spark, SQL, and Python**.

Currently based in **Dublin**, Iâ€™m pursuing a Masterâ€™s in **Data Analytics** at Dublin Business School while continuing to explore interesting data projects. My work focuses on data engineering, automation, and governance â€” making data more accessible, reliable, and insightful.

Before moving into the data space, I was part of **Team bi0s**, Indiaâ€™s top CTF cybersecurity team, and received a **Black Hat Asia scholarship** for my interest in data protection and cloud security.

If you're working with data or just enjoy swapping notes on tech, Iâ€™d love to connect.
